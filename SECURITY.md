# Security Policy

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it
privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you
to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be
used before a patch is released.

You may submit the report in the following ways:

- Github users can privately report security advisories directly here: https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js/security/advisories/new

- Send an email to inquiries+two.js@jono.fyi.

Please provide the following information in your report:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This project is maintained by volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such,
we ask that you give us 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
