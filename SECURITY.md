# Security Policy

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it
privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you
to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be
used before a patch is released.

You may submit the report in the following ways:

- Github users can privately report security advisories directly here: https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js/security/advisories/new

- Send an email to inquiries+two.js@jono.fyi.

Please provide the following information in your report:

- The version(s) where the issue is identified.
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue.
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue.
- Your recommended remediation if any.

This project is maintained by volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such,
we ask that you give us 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
