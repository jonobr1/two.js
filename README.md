# Two.js

A two-dimensional drawing api meant for modern browsers. It is renderer agnostic enabling the same api to render in multiple contexts: webgl, canvas2d, and svg.

[Home](http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js) • [Examples](http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/#examples) • [Documentation](http://jonobr1.github.io/two.js/#documentation) • [Help](https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js/issues?labels=question)

## Usage
Download the latest [minified library](https://raw.github.com/jonobr1/two.js/dev/build/two.min.js) and include it in your html.

```html
<script src="js/two.min.js"></script>
```

It can also be installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/two.js), Node Package Manager:

```js
npm install --save two.js
```
Alternatively see [how to build the library yourself](https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js#custom-build).


Here is boilerplate html in order to draw a spinning rectangle in two.js:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <script src="js/two.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      var two = new Two({
        fullscreen: true,
        autostart: true
      }).appendTo(document.body);
      var rect = two.makeRectangle(two.width / 2, two.height / 2, 50 ,50);
      two.bind('update', function() {
        rect.rotation += 0.001;
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Custom Build
Two.js uses [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) in order to build source files. You'll first want to install that. Once installed open up a terminal and head to the repository folder:

```
cd ~/path-to-repo/two.js
npm install
```

This will give you a number of libraries that the development of Two.js relies on. If for instance you only use the `SvgRenderer` then you can really cut down on the file size by excluding the other renderers. To do this, modify `/utils/build.js` to only add the files you'd like. Then run:

```
node ./utils/build
```

And the resulting `/build/two.js` and `/build/two.min.js` will be updated to your specification.

---

### Running in Headless Environments

As of version `v0.7.x` Two.js can also run in a headless environment, namely running on the server with the help of a library called [Node Canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas). We don't add Node Canvas to dependencies of Two.js because it's _not necessary_ to run it in the browser. However, it has all the hooks setup to run in a cloud environment. To get started follow the installation instructions on Automattic's [readme](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#installation). After you've done that run:

```
npm install canvas
npm install two.js
```

Now in a JavaScript file setup your Two.js scenegraph and save out frames whenever you need to:

```javascript
var { createCanvas, Image } = require('canvas');
var Two = require('two.js')

var fs = require('fs');
var path = require('path');

var width = 800;
var height = 600;

var canvas = createCanvas(width, height);
Two.Utils.shim(canvas, Image);

var time = Date.now();

var two = new Two({
  width: width,
  height: height,
  domElement: canvas
});

var rect = two.makeRectangle(width / 2, height / 2, 50, 50);
rect.fill = 'rgb(255, 100, 100)';
rect.noStroke();

two.render();

var settings = { compressionLevel: 3, filters: canvas.PNG_FILTER_NONE };
fs.writeFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, './images/rectangle.png'), canvas.toBuffer('image/png', settings));
console.log('Finished rendering. Time took: ', Date.now() - time);

process.exit();

```
